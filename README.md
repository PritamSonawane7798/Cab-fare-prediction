# Cab-fare-prediction
There is a cab rental start-up company. They have successfully run the pilot project and now want to launch there cab service across the country. I have collected the historical data from the pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for fare prediction. I need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city.
